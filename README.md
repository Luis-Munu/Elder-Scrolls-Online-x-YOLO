# Elder Scrolls Online x YOLO
A YOLOv5 model for Elder Scrolls Online

Trained at 4k res, detects Bal-Foyen enemies, Harvest map indicators and various resources in real time.
The accuracy detecting resources leaves a lot to be desired due to lack of labeled dataset, labeling by hand is hard guys!

There's also a python script that works as a transparent overlay to draw detected objects in real time as you play.
What you do with this is up to you, botting is against the TOS of the game.

If for some reason you feel compelled to enhance the model hit me up on GitHub.
